an excellent work-life balance, with minimal meetings, plenty of time for focused work, and numerous opportunities to learn and 
collaborate with one another.

### Fully Funded for Success
All positions are **fully funded**, so you can focus entirely on your research and growth. PhD positions are always funded for 4 years. PostDoc and Research Engineer positions are usually for 2-4 years, with possibilities for extension.

### World-leading research
We change the world, together. We’re a tight-knit team of about 20 PhD's, postdocs, and engineers working together to create real impact. 
You can find our work in [top AI conferences and journals](publications/publications.html), including NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, JMLR, and TPAMI, 
and we take pride in [good engineering and open science](software/software.html), building AI tools used by hundreds of thousands of people.

### Freedom to Study Deeply and Think Big
We don’t just follow trends — we set them. We encourage every team member to become a leading expert, think outside the box, and find novel avenues of research.
We work on extremey efficient continual and meta-learning inspired by the human brain, we design AI models that design themselves using AutoML,
we <a href="https://www.openml.org/" target="_blank">build platforms</a> and <a href="https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/data/croissant/" target="_blank">create standards</a>
that enable research that wasn't possible before, and even create new venues 
(e.g. <a href="https://neuripsconf.medium.com/announcing-the-neurips-2021-datasets-and-benchmarks-track-644e27c1e66c" target="_blank">NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks</a>)
to create new incentives and strengthen communities.

### Purpose-Driven Research
